# Progress Log Tracker for AWS IoT Project

# Log 2016-03-18

# Built GoPiGo2 
# Ref: http://www.dexterindustries.com/gopigo2-tutorials-documentation

# WiP - Explore GoPiGo2 
	- Development Options : How to get sensor data into JSON format or batch writes to DDB
	- Code Base : Javascript (more community support i've seen when integrating cloud services)

# Story #1 - As a maker enthusiast, I want to track all metrics of my Iot device so that I can display stats on my Iot fan page.

	Task #1 - Explore potential sensor data to consider metric (look at some examples, learn code base)

	Task #2 - Create DDB Table "GoPiGo2" with 10 R/W of provisioned throughput (determine unique partition and sort key)

	Task #3 - Develop rudimentary UI to display updated settings (txt,csv,json format, later UI will read from DDB Table)

	Task #4 - Deploy code and run on GoPiGo2 device, stand-up web server (later this is going to Elasticsearch or D3JS)

# Far Estimate
	- Story #1 completion will most likely take at least 1 month to complete myself considering the couple of hrs a day I can devote to this project.
